# ATS-System
Softair's Air Ticket System

-- How to use the program --
1. Open IntelliJ and from the dashboard select import project, then select the project folder you stored.
2. You are almost ready to go, since im using JavaFX you will also need the library to run the system.
   **Download JavaFX from here https://openjfx.io/
   Make sure you store it in a good place.
   Open Intelli, then opne this folder and do the following. File -> Project Structure -> Global Libraries -> The "+" symbol
   The find the JavaFX file and go to its /lib, select all the files in there then click add.
   You may then have to right click javafx-swt in global libraries and click Add to Module.
